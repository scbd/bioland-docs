## Using Search

Bioland 2 features an updated search functionality. It is accessible directly as an advanced search and – behind the scenes – powers many of the lists of entries that make Bioland search-engine friendly.

### Accessing Advanced Search Directly

![Search Bar Location](/images/bioland/bl2-02-000.png)

Search is available throughout the site from its global position in the top-right of the page.

The search can be started directly from the input box by entering a term followed by enter key.

To access the advanced search without a specific term, just hitting enter will work. Or the Loup symbol can be clicked on with the mouse.

### Choosing the Content to Search

![Search Tabs - Site Content vs Secretariat](/images/bioland/bl2-02-001.png)

The search interface differentiates between searching the local site content and searching information from the global CHM via interoperability with the secretariat. Local content search supports additional filtering by content type that is not available with the Secretariat search. Switching between tabs (search types) reset the search terms.

The search itself is responsive. If you pause typing the query or select a content type, the search results are updated immediately.

For the keywords search, all entered keywords must be present in the found documents, but in any order or location. If a phrase search is required instead, the phrase can be entered in the double-quotes. For example: "subregional dialogue".

### Searching Local Site

The local site search allows you to filter by content type to narrow down your results.

## Managing Content

Bioland 2 content comes from five main sources:

1. **Partner Content**: Data from GBIF, Panorama, and other partners via global interoperability
2. **Secretariat Content**: News, events, and national targets from SCBD via CHM interoperability  
3. **Local Content**: Your site's own news, events, learning resources, protected areas, etc.
4. **Forum Content**: Topics and comments from community discussions
5. **Structural Elements**: Menus and navigation components

### Adding Local Content

Local content is what you create and manage directly on your site. This guide covers adding local (site) content - the third source of content listed above.

#### Accessing the Content Management Screen

There are several ways to access the Content Management screen, depending on your current location and permissions.

**From the public site:**

## Adding Users

User management allows you to control who can access and edit your Bioland 2 site.

### Availability of Functionality

Managing users is a functionality only available to users with the role of **Site Manager**. While there is a self-registration option for new users, they still need to be confirmed and have the roles assigned by the existing user with the Site Manager permissions.

### User Roles

Bioland 2 supports several user roles:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Site Manager** | Full access to all features, settings, and user management |
| **Content Manager** | Can create, edit, and publish content; can manage menus |
| **Editor** | Can create, edit, and publish content |
| **Contributor** | Can create content but cannot manage menus or publish directly |
| **Viewer** | Can only view content (for restricted areas) |

::: tip Role Permissions
Menu editing is available to users with **Content Manager** role and above. It is not available to the Contributor role.
:::

### Accessing User Management Interface

The user management screen is part of the administration interface. There are three ways to access it, once logged-in with the Site Manager permissions:

1. **Direct access:**
   Navigate directly to the People administration page:
   ```
   https://sitename/en/admin/people
   ```
   For example: `https://training.bl2.chm-cbd.net/en/admin/people`

2. **From public interface via Quick Admin menu's People menu entry:**
   
   When logged in with Site Manager permissions, look for the Quick Admin menu at the top of the page and select **People**.

   <!-- SCREENSHOT NEEDED: /images/bioland/bl2-04-000.png -->

3. **Via the Administration menu:**
   
   From the full Administration interface, navigate to the People section.

   <!-- SCREENSHOT NEEDED: /images/bioland/bl2-04-001.png -->

### The People Management Screen

The People management screen displays a list of all users on your site with their:
- Username
- Status (Active/Blocked)
- Roles
- Member since date
- Last access date

<!-- SCREENSHOT NEEDED: /images/bioland/bl2-04-002.png -->

You can filter and sort the list to find specific users.

### Creating New Users

There are two ways users can be added to the system:

#### Method 1: Site Manager Creates User

1. Access the User Management interface using one of the methods above
2. Click the **Add user** button

   <!-- SCREENSHOT NEEDED: /images/bioland/bl2-04-003.png -->

3. Fill in the Create new account form:

   <!-- SCREENSHOT NEEDED: /images/bioland/bl2-04-004.png -->

   - **Email address**: The user's email (required)
   - **Username**: A unique identifier for the user
   - **Password**: Set a password or use the system invitation
   - **Status**: Set to Active to allow immediate access
   - **Roles**: Select the appropriate role(s) for this user
   - **Notify user**: Choose whether to send a welcome email

4. Save the user

#### Method 2: Self-Registration (User Requests Access)

When self-registration is enabled, users can request access themselves:

1. The user visits the site and clicks **Create new account**
2. They fill in their details and submit the registration
3. The new user is created with a **Blocked** status

   <!-- SCREENSHOT NEEDED: /images/bioland/bl2-04-005.png -->

4. A Site Manager must then review and approve the account

### Approving Self-Registered Users

When a user self-registers, their account starts in **Blocked** status. To approve them:

1. Navigate to the People management screen
2. Find the user (they will show as "Blocked")
3. Click the **Edit** button next to the user

   <!-- SCREENSHOT NEEDED: /images/bioland/bl2-04-006.png -->

4. On the edit screen:
   - Review and edit the user's name if needed
   - Verify the email address
   - **Select the correct role(s)** for this user
   - **Change the status to "Active"** (this is the most important step!)

::: warning Important
The most important step when approving a self-registered user is to change their status from **Blocked** to **Active**. Without this, the user cannot log in.
:::

5. Save the changes

6. The user receives an email notification:
   - States that their account was approved
   - Provides a single-use password-reset link
   - Allows them to set their own password and log in

### Managing User Permissions

To modify an existing user's access:

1. Go to User Management interface
2. Find the user you want to modify
3. Click on their username or the **Edit** button
4. Adjust the following as needed:
   - **Status**: Active or Blocked
   - **Roles**: Add or remove user roles
   - **Email**: Update if necessary
5. Save changes

::: tip Blocking Users
To temporarily disable a user's access without deleting their account, change their status to **Blocked**. They can be reactivated later by changing the status back to **Active**.
:::

## Managing Menus

Menus control the navigation structure of your site. You can add content to menus to make it easily accessible to visitors.

### Introduction

While the menus can be edited from the administration interface, sometimes it is useful to add new content item to the menu directly during the creation, or edit an existing item to add it to the menu. Both can be done in the same way, as part of the item editing interface.

The menu editing is available to users with **Content Manager** role and above. It is not available to the Contributor role.

### Editing Interface

![Menu Settings Panel](/images/bioland/menu-settings-panel.png)

The editing interface is part of the right tool bar called **"Menu setting"**. By default, the interface is closed and only the current status shown.

Expand the interface to see the checkbox to provide a menu link.

Once the checkbox is clicked, there are four fields. Of those, two are compulsory and the other two are optional.

| Field | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| **Menu link title** | The text that will appear in the menu (see later section for translations) |
| **Description** | Optional. Not used at the moment. |
| **Parent link** | The choice of the menu and submenu, under which the link will appear. This includes both top and bottom menus. |
| **Weight** | Optional. Allows to control the order of this item within the chosen menu. While it can be controlled from here, it is easy to use drag and drop in the main menu administration interface for this purpose. |

Please note that while it is technically possible to place a menu link under another menu link, such as `Footer/Quick Links/Home`, it will not display as a submenu. So, the correct location in this example would be `Footer/Quick Links`.

![Menu Settings - Parent Link](/images/bioland/menu-settings---parent-link.png)

Similarly, when the menu has several submenus, the item needs to be added at the level of the submenu. While additional submenus are allowed, care needs to be taken to avoid visual overflow of the content.

Use Weight field or main menu admin interface to control placement of the new menu item relative to the existing one.

Finally, if the document is not published, the link to it will not appear on the menu. Therefore, the menu link can be safely setup while the document is still in the draft mode.

::: info Menu Caching
Menus are not changed frequently and therefore are cached. Force refreshing the web page may be required to see the changes.
:::

### Menus and Their Visual Location

The following is the name of the menus in alphabetical order as presented by the interface and their visual location on the Bioland site:

| Menu | Location |
|------|----------|
| **Biodiversity Facts** | Top menu, 2nd |
| **Conventions & Protocols** | Top menu, 1st |
| **Cooperation** | Top menu, 4th |
| **Footer** | The bottom of the page with four-columns (submenus) |
| **Footer Credits** | Bottom-right of the page, under the footer |
| **Implementation** | Top menu, 3rd |
| **News & Updates** | Top menu, 5th |
| **Resources** | Top menu, 6th |

### Managing Menu Items from Admin Interface

To manage menus from the admin interface:

1. Access the Admin interface
2. Navigate to **Structure** > **Menus**
3. Select the menu you want to edit
4. You can:
   - Add new menu items
   - Drag and drop to reorder items
   - Edit existing menu items
   - Delete menu items
5. Save the menu when done

### Menu Best Practices

- Keep menu items concise and descriptive
- Organize content logically
- Avoid creating too many top-level items
- Use submenus for related content, but avoid deep nesting
- Test navigation from a user's perspective

::: tip Draft Content
If your content is not published, the menu link will not appear on the public site. This allows you to safely set up menu links while content is still in draft mode.
:::

::: info Menu Caching
Menus are cached for performance. You may need to force refresh your web browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R) to see menu changes immediately.
:::

## Translating Content

Bioland 2 supports multi-language content to reach a broader audience.

### Introduction

A piece of content can exist in all the languages of the site. The link between different translations of the same content item is maintained and some of the fields do not need to be translated, for example dates.

When showing an item or a menu linking to the item, the best available translation is shown. In cases where the translation does not exist, the default (usually English) version of the content or menu link is shown.

### How Translation Works

- Each content item can have multiple language versions (all 6 UN languages)
- Translations are linked to the original content
- Bioland tries to display content in the chosen language
- If a translation is not available, it falls back to the system language (usually English)
- Users can switch between available languages

::: tip Menu Translations
Remember that menus need to be translated separately. If content is translated but the menu link is not, the English menu text will show instead.
:::

### Checking Existing Translations

There are 3 ways to see the translations of an item:

#### 1. Using the Content Management Interface Language Filter

In the Content Management interface, switch to a specific language or to all languages using the Filter's Language drop-down. This allows you to:

- View content in a specific language
- See all content items regardless of language
- Identify which items need translation

#### 2. Using the Translate Menu

From the content editing screen:

1. Look for the **Translate** menu or tab
2. This shows all available translations for the current content item
3. You can see which languages have translations and which don't

#### 3. Viewing the Translate Tab

The Translate tab on a content item shows:

![Translation Tabs](/images/bioland/translation-tabs.png)

- All available language versions
- Publication status of each translation
- Quick access to create or edit translations

### Creating Translations

To create or edit a translation:

1. Navigate to the content item you want to translate
2. Look for the **Translate** tab or **Add Translation** option
3. Select the target language from the available options
4. Enter the translated content:
   - **Title**: Translated title
   - **Body text**: Main content translation
   - **Other translatable fields**: Any additional fields that support translation
5. Set the publication status (Draft or Published)
6. Save the translation

::: warning Publication Status
A translation can be in Draft mode while the original content is Published. Draft translations will not be visible to public users until published.
:::

### Translation Best Practices

- Ensure translations are accurate and culturally appropriate
- Keep the same structure and formatting as the original
- Translate all important fields, including metadata
- Review translations with native speakers when possible
- Use consistent terminology across all translations
- Remember that some fields (like dates) are shared and don't need translation
- Test how content appears in each language

### Viewing Unpublished Translations

The system distinguishes between:

- **Published translations**: Visible to all users
- **Draft/Unpublished translations**: Only visible to content managers and above

You can manage unpublished translations through the Unpublished tab, which shows:

- Content items with unpublished translations
- The specific languages that are unpublished
- Quick access to edit and publish

### Common Translation Scenarios

**All Content Published**  
All language versions are live and visible to users based on their language preference.

**Some Translations Missing**  
Users will see the default language version (typically English) for untranslated content.

**Draft Translations**  
Content managers can preview and edit draft translations before making them public.

### Menu Translation

![Translation Tabs](/images/bioland/translation-tabs.png)

Content may exist in all 6 UN languages and the content in different languages is linked together. Bioland tries to display content in the chosen language and will fall back to system language (usually English), when the translation is not available.

This applies to the menus as well. If the content is translated, but the menu link is not, the English menu text will show instead.

::: tip Menu Translations
Remember that menus need to be translated separately. If content is translated but the menu link is not, the English menu text will show instead.
:::
