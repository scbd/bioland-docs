## Tips and Best Practices

### Link Management

- **Use descriptive titles** — Menu link titles should clearly describe where the link goes. Avoid vague text like "Click here" or "More info".
- **Use internal autocomplete** — When adding links to site pages, type the page title in the **Link** field and select from the autocomplete suggestions. This avoids broken links from typos.
- **Keep menus concise** — Limit the number of top-level links in each menu. Too many items overwhelm users.

### Reordering and Nesting

- **Save after reordering** — Drag-and-drop changes are NOT saved automatically. Always click **Save** at the bottom of the page after reordering.
- **Limit nesting depth** — Avoid nesting links more than 2 levels deep. Deeply nested links are hard for users to find.
- **Test on the front end** — After reordering or nesting, visit the live site to confirm the menu looks correct.

### Translation

- **Translate link titles** — When translating a menu link, provide the translated title and update the link if the target page has a translated version.
- **Check all languages** — After making changes, verify that translated versions of the menu still make sense.

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Happens | How to Fix |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Link not appearing | **Enabled** checkbox is unchecked | Edit the link and check the **Enabled** box |
| Broken internal link | URL typed manually instead of using autocomplete | Edit the link and use the autocomplete in the **Link** field |
| Changes lost after reorder | Forgot to click **Save** | Always click **Save** at the bottom after reordering |
| Link in wrong position | Dragged to the wrong spot | Re-drag the link and check nesting level, then **Save** |
| Cannot find Structure menu | Logged in as Contributor or Authenticated User | Menu management requires Content Manager or Site Manager role |
