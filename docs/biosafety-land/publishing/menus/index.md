# Menus

Menus define the navigation structure of your site. This guide shows you how to manage the **links within existing menus** — adding, editing, deleting, and reordering menu links.

## Who Can Manage Menus?

| Role | Can Manage Menu Links | Can Add/Delete Menus |
|------|:---------------------:|:--------------------:|
| **Site Manager** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Content Manager** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Contributor** | ❌ No | ❌ No |

::: info
Content Managers and Site Managers have **identical** menu management capabilities. No role can add or delete menus — only manage the links within existing menus.

## Overview

Your site comes with six predefined menus:

| Menu | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Footer** | Site information links displayed in the footer |
| **Footer Credits** | Credit and attribution links |
| **National Biosafety Framework** | Links related to the national biosafety framework |
| **News & Updates** | Links to news and update sections |
| **Resources** | Links to resource pages and documents |
| **Useful Links** | External and internal reference links |

### What You Can Do

- **Add** new links to any menu
- **Edit** existing link titles, URLs, and settings
- **Delete** links that are no longer needed
- **Reorder** links by dragging and dropping
- **Add child links** to create sub-navigation
- **Translate** links into other languages
- **Enable/Disable** links without deleting them

### What You Cannot Do

- **Add new menus** — Access Denied for all roles
- **Delete entire menus** — no UI available for this operation

### Navigation Path

Both Content Managers and Site Managers access menus the same way:

**Admin toolbar** → **Structure** → **Menus**
