### Understanding the Files Tab

The Files tab is a **management view** — it shows all files uploaded across the site through content and media forms. You cannot add or edit files directly from this tab.

**What you CAN do:**
- View all files on the site
- Filter files by name, MIME type, or status
- See where files are used ("Used in" column)
- Delete files that are no longer needed

**What you CANNOT do from this tab:**
- Add new files (use Content or Media forms instead)
- Edit file names or descriptions (edit the parent content/media item instead)
- Replace files (edit the parent content/media item instead)

### Best Practices for Deleting Files

**Before You Delete:**
1. Check the **Used in** column — if it shows "1 place" or more, the file is referenced
2. Click the usage link to see which content/media items use the file
3. Ask your team if anyone needs this file
4. Consider keeping old files for a while

**Safety Checklist:**
- [ ] Is this the correct file?
- [ ] Have I checked the "Used in" column?
- [ ] Have I checked with my team?
- [ ] Do we have a backup?
- [ ] Am I sure we don't need this file?

**When to Delete:**
- File shows "0 places" in Used in column
- File was uploaded by mistake
- File is a temporary upload that was never used
- You have confirmed no content references it

**When NOT to Delete:**
- File is used in published content (Used in > 0)
- You're not sure if others need it
- File might be needed later
- You haven't checked with your team

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Deleting:**
- ❌ Don't delete files without checking the "Used in" column
- ❌ Don't delete files that show 1+ places of usage
- ❌ Don't delete without asking your team
- ✅ Do check "Used in" count before every delete
- ✅ Do click the usage link to verify references
- ✅ Do ask your team first

### File Management Tips

**Monitoring:**
- Use the **Filename** filter to find specific files quickly
- Use the **MIME type** filter to find all images, PDFs, etc.
- Sort by **Changed date** to find recent uploads
- Sort by **Size** to find large files consuming storage

**Cleanup:**
- Regularly review files with "0 places" usage — these may be safe to delete
- Check for "Temporary" status files — these are often incomplete uploads
- Monitor file uploads for size compliance
