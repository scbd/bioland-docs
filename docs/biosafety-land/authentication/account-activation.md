1. Go to the [login page](/biosafety-land/authentication/login)
2. Click **Forgot Password** (or **Reset Password**)
3. Enter the same email address where you received the activation email
4. Follow the instructions in the password reset email to set your password

::: tip
Use the same email address that received the original activation email — this is the email linked to your account.
