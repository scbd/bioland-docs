## Managing Roles and Permissions

Site Managers can assign and change user roles.

Roles control what users can do in the system.

### Available Roles

There are three main roles:

1. **Contributor**
   - Can create and edit their own content
   - Can upload their own media
   - Cannot publish content
   - Cannot manage other users

2. **Content Manager**
   - Can manage all content and media
   - Can publish and unpublish content
   - Can manage menus and files
   - Cannot manage users or system settings

3. **Site Manager**
   - Can do everything
   - Can manage users and permissions
   - Can change system settings
   - Can access all areas

### Assigning Roles (Site Manager)

Follow these steps to assign or change roles:

#### Step 1: Open the Person's Edit Form

1. Follow steps 1-5 from "Editing a Person" above.
2. You should see the edit form for the person.

<!-- SCREENSHOT NEEDED: /images/biosafety-land/people/people-roles-site-manager-1-edit-form.png -->

#### Step 2: Find the Roles Section

1. Scroll down to the **Roles** section.
2. You will see checkboxes for each role.
3. Checked boxes show current roles.

<!-- SCREENSHOT NEEDED: /images/biosafety-land/people/people-roles-site-manager-2-roles-section.png -->

#### Step 3: Add or Remove Roles

1. To add a role, check its checkbox.
2. To remove a role, uncheck its checkbox.
3. You can give a user multiple roles.
4. Most users need only one role.

<!-- SCREENSHOT NEEDED: /images/biosafety-land/people/people-roles-site-manager-3-select-roles.png -->

#### Step 4: Review Role Changes

1. Think about what the user needs to do.
2. Give them only the permissions they need.
3. More permissions mean more responsibility.
4. Check that the roles make sense together.

<!-- SCREENSHOT NEEDED: /images/biosafety-land/people/people-roles-site-manager-4-review.png -->

#### Step 5: Save the Changes

1. Click the **Save** button.
2. The system will update the user's roles.
3. You will see a success message.
4. The new permissions take effect immediately.

<!-- SCREENSHOT NEEDED: /images/biosafety-land/people/people-roles-site-manager-5-save.png -->

**Important Notes About Roles**:
- Users see different menu options based on their roles
- Removing a role immediately removes those permissions
- Users might need to log out and back in to see changes
- Be careful when changing Site Manager roles
- Always have at least one Site Manager active

### Common Role Combinations

Here are typical role setups:

| User Type | Recommended Role | Why |
|-----------|-----------------|-----|
| New writer | Contributor | Can write but needs approval |
| Editor | Content Manager | Can manage all content |
| Administrator | Site Manager | Can manage everything |
| Trusted editor | Content Manager + Contributor | More flexible editing |

**Tip**: Start users with fewer permissions. Add more as needed.

| Capability | Contributor | Content Manager | Site Manager |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| View their own profile | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

## Best Practices

### For Adding People

1. **Use Strong Passwords**
   - Mix letters, numbers, and symbols
   - Make passwords at least 8 characters
   - Don't use common words or dates

2. **Start with Minimal Roles**
   - Give new users only what they need
   - Add more roles later if needed
   - This keeps the system more secure

3. **Use Clear Information**
   - Use real names
   - Use work email addresses
   - Fill in organization and job title
   - This helps identify users later

4. **Set Status Correctly**
   - Check "Active" if they should log in now
   - Leave unchecked if setting up for later
   - You can always activate them later

5. **Document User Purposes**
   - Add a note about why you created them
   - This helps other Site Managers
   - Use the Bio field for this

### For Editing People

1. **Be Careful with Emails**
   - Changing email changes their login
   - Tell the user before you change it
   - They might get locked out

2. **Check Before Changing Roles**
   - Removing roles removes permissions
   - Make sure they don't need that role
   - Check if they have content to manage

3. **Coordinate Changes**
   - Tell the user about major changes
   - Especially role or status changes
   - This prevents confusion

4. **Update All Information**
   - If someone changes jobs, update their title
   - If they move teams, update organization
   - Keep profiles current

5. **Keep Records**
   - Note why you made changes
   - Use a log or ticket system
   - This helps track user history

### For Deleting People

1. **Block Instead When Possible**
   - Blocking is reversible
   - Deleting is permanent
   - Block first, delete later if needed

2. **Check for Content First**
   - Look at what content they created
   - Decide what happens to their content
   - Reassign important content first

3. **Get Approval**
   - Check your organization's policy
   - Get manager approval if needed
   - Document the decision

4. **Communicate**
   - Tell the user if appropriate
   - Tell their team if needed
   - Plan the timing carefully

5. **Clean Up After**
   - Check for orphaned content
   - Update any references to them
   - Review team assignments

### For Blocking/Unblocking People

1. **Block for Temporary Issues**
   - Use blocking for suspensions
   - Use it for inactive periods
   - Use it for security concerns

2. **Don't Delete Too Soon**
   - Block first to see if it's needed
   - Wait before deleting permanently
   - You might need to restore access

3. **Track Blocked Users**
   - Keep a list of blocked users
   - Note why they were blocked
   - Review periodically

4. **Unblock Carefully**
   - Check why they were blocked first
   - Make sure the issue is resolved
   - Verify with management if needed

### For Managing Roles

1. **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Give users minimum permissions needed
   - Add more only when necessary
   - Review permissions regularly

2. **Avoid Too Many Site Managers**
   - Limit the number of Site Managers
   - Too many can be a security risk
   - Usually 2-3 is enough

3. **Be Careful Removing Roles**
   - Check what they're currently doing
   - Make sure they finish important tasks
   - Don't remove during active work

4. **Document Role Changes**
   - Note why roles were changed
   - Keep a log of permission changes
   - This helps with audits

5. **Regular Permission Reviews**
   - Review user roles quarterly
   - Remove roles people don't need anymore
   - Update based on job changes

### General Best Practices

1. **Regular Audits**
   - Review the user list monthly
   - Check for inactive accounts
   - Verify roles are still correct

2. **Security First**
   - Use strong passwords always
   - Enable two-factor if available
   - Block suspicious accounts immediately

3. **Clear Communication**
   - Tell users about changes affecting them
   - Provide clear instructions
   - Be available for questions

4. **Backup Before Big Changes**
   - If your system has backup/export
   - Export user list before major changes
   - This helps if you need to undo

5. **Train Other Site Managers**
   - Make sure other Site Managers know these processes
   - Share best practices
   - Have backup people who can help
