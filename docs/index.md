## About Bioland Tools

The Bioland Tool is a comprehensive suite of national-level web applications supporting the Convention on Biological Diversity's (CBD) National CHM and the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety's National BCH. It provides countries with modern, user-friendly platforms for biodiversity and biosafety information management.  

### Two Specialized Platforms

**Bioland (National CHM)** - The National Clearing-House Mechanism platform for biological diversity knowledge management. It enables countries to access global CBD content while publishing and organizing their own national biodiversity news, educational materials, awareness campaigns, and community engagement — directly delivering on Section K commitments at the national level.

**Biosafety Land (National BCH)** - The Biosafety Clearing-House platform for managing Living Modified Organism (LMO) information and implementing the Cartagena Protocol framework. It provides specialized tools for documenting field trials, biosafety-related events, and publications. Beyond regulatory content, the platform enables countries to raise public awareness of biosafety issues, share educational resources, and communicate national biosafety news — strengthening Section K delivery in the biosafety domain.

### Key Capabilities

- **🌍 Global Integration** - Access central CHM and BCH knowledge bases
- **📝 Content Management** - Publish and organize national information
- **🔐 Access Control** - Role-based permissions for secure collaboration
- **🗂️ Flexible Organization** - Customizable menus and navigation
- **🌐 Multi-language Support** - Built-in translation workflows
- **🎨 Customization** - Configurable to match national branding

Both platforms are designed to  facilitate international knowledge sharing, and support capacity building in biodiversity and biosafety management. As well as key implementation tools for [Section K of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF)](https://www.cbd.int/gbf/communication), they support countries in communication, education, public awareness, and uptake of biodiversity and biosafety knowledge.
