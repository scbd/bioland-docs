::: info
You only need to create a GitHub account once. If you already have one, skip to [Finding and Navigating the Documentation](./02-navigating-repo.md).

::: tip
Choose a recognizable username such as `firstname-lastname` or `firstname-organization`. This helps reviewers identify who submitted changes.

### Step 3: Verify Your Email

1. Check your email inbox for a message from GitHub
2. Open the email and click the **verification link**
3. You will be redirected back to GitHub

::: warning
If you do not see the verification email, check your spam or junk folder. You must verify your email before you can contribute.
:::

### Step 4: Set Up Your Profile (Optional)

1. Click your profile icon in the top-right corner of GitHub
2. Click **Settings**
3. Under **Public profile**, add your name and a profile picture
4. Click **Update profile**

This is optional, but it helps the documentation team know who is contributing.

### Next Steps

Now that you have a GitHub account, proceed to [Finding and Navigating the Documentation](./02-navigating-repo.md) to find the documentation files you want to edit.
